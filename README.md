<h2 align="center">Getting Started</h2>

The Jupyter Notebook `.ipynb` files can be opened using either [Google Colaboratory](https://colab.research.google.com) or locally using [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) and 3-rd party extensions.

If you decide to use Visual Studio Code to open the `.ipynb` files locally, be sure to download these required software:
* [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) (3.10 or above)
* [Jupyter Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-toolsai.jupyter) (can be installed within Visual Studio Code through the `Extensions` tab)

**CAUTION:** Since the `listings.csv` was too large to be directly published to GitHub, it has been included inside `dataset.zip`. Remember to unzip the folder and make sure the folder's name is `dataset`.
